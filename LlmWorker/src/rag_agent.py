        This class encapsulates all generation services. It acts
        as a stateless, thread-safe manager designed to be instantiated exactly once
        at application startup using its asynchronous factory method.

        Example:
            # At FastAPI application startup (lifespan hook):
            app.state.agent = await LLMAgent.create()

            # Shutdown:
            await app.state.agent.close()
